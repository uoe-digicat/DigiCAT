Home CA description,"The aim of counterfactual analysis is to estimate the causal effects of interventions or treatments, by comparing what actually happened (observed outcomes) with what would have happened if a different action had been taken (counterfactual outcomes). In observational settings, where random allocation into different treatments is not possible, researchers often employ methods involving 'propensity scores' (the estimated probability of receiving the treatment/intervention, based on a set of observed covariates). These propensity scores can then be used in an analysis to balance the characteristics of treatment vs non-treated groups, reducing bias and enabling a more accurate estimation of the causal effect of receiving the treatment.

Approach Binary description,"The aim of counterfactual analysis is to estimate the causal effects of 'exposures' or 'treatments' by comparing what actually happened (observed outcomes) with what would have happened if a different action had been taken (counterfactual outcomes). Because we can never directly observe counterfactual outcomes, we compare groups who differ in their treatment. However, in observational settings where random allocation into different treatments is not possible, researchers may employ methods that such as 'matching' or 'weighting' of participants to ensure that the different treatment groups being compared are 'balanced' with respect to other characteristics.",Temp
Approach PSM description,You've chosen propensity matching. This approach involves creating balanced comparison groups by matching treated individuals with similar untreated individuals based on their propensity scores (probability of someone having a specific treatment based on a set of ‘matching variables’). This aims to ensure that the groups are comparable in terms of potential confounding variables. The treatment effect is then estimated by comparing outcomes between the matched groups. ,Temp
Approach CA link, For further guidance on choosing an approach see the ‘choosing a counterfactual analysis approach’ section of the tutorials.,Temp
Approach PSM link, See the ‘propensity matching’ section of the tutorials for more information.,Temp
Approach IPTW description,"You’ve chosen IPTW. IPTW aims to rebalance treated and untreated individuals using a weighted regression approach. It first estimates propensity scores (probability of someone having a specific treatment based on a set of ‘matching variables’. It then transforms these into weights that are used in a regression model to up-weight (i.e., give more importance to) untreated and treated cases that are similar in terms of their propensity scores and down-weight cases that are very different. This helps to rebalance the treated and untreated groups.",Temp
Approach IPTW link,See the ‘IPTW’ section of the tutorials for more information.,Temp
Approach NBP description,"As you have an ordinal treatment variable (i.e., an ordered categorical treatment variable) an appropriate counterfactual analysis approach is non-bipartite propensity matching (NBP). NBP finds pairs of people who differ in their treatment dosage but who have similar treatment propensities based on their matching variables and compares their outcome variable levels. As the treatment is ordinal, this might involve matching and comparing people with for example, low with medium treatment doses and medium with high doses.",Temp
Approach NBP tutorial link,Please see the 'NBP' section of the tutorials for more information.,Temp
Approach CBPS description,"You’ve chosen Covariate Balancing Propensity Score (CBPS). Here coefficients of a generalised linear model (for binary treatments), multinomial logistic regression model (for multi-category treatments), or linear regression model (for continuous treatments) are estimated and used to compute propensity scores. Standard regression score equations are replaced with balance constraints in a generalised method of moments estimation, maximising both covariate balance and prediction of treatment assignment.",

Approach Missingness description,"Missing data can reduce statistical power and introduce bias when it is related to the variables under study. In order to minimise the impact of missingness in our data, DigiCAT offers several approaches to handle missing values. ",Temp
Approach Missingness tutorial link,"For more information on missingness, see the ‘missing data’ section of the tutorials.",Temp
Approach MI description,"The fundamental idea behind multiple imputation is to create several (M) completed datasets by predicting what the missing values would have been if we could observe them. These datasets are then analysed separately, and the results of each of these datasets are combined, or ‘pooled’, together. The variability across datasets allows the standard errors to take account of the uncertainty due to the fact that some of the data are predicted rather than observed. DigiCAT imputes 5 complete datasets, conducts the analysis in each and then combines the results across them. However, don’t forget that this statistical method relies on assumptions, which can be difficult to test. If these assumptions are violated, your inferences may be invalid. Multiple imputation assumes ‘missingness at random’ (MAR) meaning that the missingness depends on the data you have available in your model but not on the unobserved values of the outcome variable.",Temp
Approach MI tutorial link,Please see our tutorial pages on multiple imputation for a detailed discussion.,Temp
Approach CC description,"Complete case analysis (CCA) (also sometimes known as ‘listwise deletion’), will only analyse the completely observed cases. This analysis will allow valid inferences of your data if the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR), because the observed values will be a random sample of the complete dataset. If the data are missing at random (MAR) which means that the missingness can be predicted from the data available or missing not at random (MNAR), the inferences may be invalid.",Temp
Approach CC tutorial link,Please see our tutorial pages for a detailed discussion of complete case analysis.,Temp
Approach Weighting description,Non-response weighting deals with missingness by up-weighting cases that have a low probability of being observed in the sample and down-weighting variables that have a high probability of being observed in the sample. This is done using a weighted regression approach. These weights are often supplied with datasets and are selected at the ‘data upload’ stage of DigiCAT. ,Temp

All the data are used (unlike in some methods where some cases might not achieve a match and be discarded). In DigiCAT the ATE is estimated which means that the weights used essentially down-weight treated cases with a high propensity score and up-weight control cases with a low propensity score. This ‘re-balances’ the treatment and control groups to make them more similar.",Temp

This avoids the iterative process between model fitting and balance checking that may be required in other counterfactual approaches. All the data are used (unlike in some methods where some cases might not achieve a match and be discarded). In DigiCAT the ATE is estimated which means that the weights used essentially up-weight/down-weight individuals accordingly to achieve covariate balance.",

Balancing NN tutorial link,See the nearest neighbour matching tutorial for more details.,Temp
Balancing Optimal ordinal description,"NBP uses a version of optimal matching to pair up cases who experienced different dosages of the treatment variable (e.g., high versus medium; medium versus low).

This option is recommended for matching methods as it addresses the fact that dependencies (or ‘clustering’) are introduced into the data due to matching. It can also help to deal with the effects of any remaining imbalance that isn’t completely addressed by the matching or weighting.,Temp

Outcome LogReg description,"Logistic regression is a way of modelling the associations between exploratory variable(s) and a binary outcome variable. The model takes the form y = 1 / (1 + exp(-(bX + e)), where y and x are our outcome and explanatory variables respectively, and e is the random error. The functional form of the model is bounded between zero and one and so can be interpreted as the probability that the outcome is positive (y = 1). Of interest here is the exp(b), which is the odds ratio of the treatment effect. As an example, if exp(B) = 2 then the outcome is twice as likely to occur in the treated population than the non treated. By fitting a model to a sample that is either matched or weighted according to the propensity of treatment, we can better estimate the **causal** effect of the treatment on our outcome variable. As you select an outcome model option more information will appear.",Temp

Sensitivity Analysis title,Sensitivity Analysis:,
Sensitivity Analysis description,"After completing a propensity score analysis,  it is important to perform sensitivity analyses afterwards, in order to examine the robustness of their causal claims. Whilst propensity score methods aim to balance observed covariates between groups, accounting for measured confounding, it cannot address unmeasured confounding variables that may continue to have an impact on the results.  
There are several means of conducting sensitivity analyses, a selection of which are available in DigiCAT at present, for continuous and binary outcomes.",
Sensitivity Analysis RR title,Rosenbaum’s Bounds: ,
Sensitivity Analysis RR description,"Rosenbaum’s bounds assess how hidden bias may affect study results using a sensitivity parameter, Gamma (Γ). If p-values stay significant at higher Γ values, results are robust; otherwise, they may be sensitive to hidden bias. DigiCAT computes Γ from X to Y. ",
