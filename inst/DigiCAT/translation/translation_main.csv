Home CA description,"The aim of counterfactual analysis is to estimate the causal effects of interventions or treatments, by comparing what actually happened (observed outcomes) with what would have happened if a different action had been taken (counterfactual outcomes). In observational settings, where random allocation into different treatments is not possible, researchers often employ methods involving 'propensity scores' (the estimated probability of receiving the treatment/intervention, based on a set of observed covariates). These propensity scores can then be used in an analysis to balance the characteristics of treatment vs non-treated groups, reducing bias and enabling a more accurate estimation of the causal effect of receiving the treatment.

Approach Description,Description:,Temp
Approach Binary description,"The aim of counterfactual analysis is to estimate the causal effects of 'exposures' or 'treatments' by comparing what actually happened (observed outcomes) with what would have happened if a different action had been taken (counterfactual outcomes). Because we can never directly observe counterfactual outcomes, we compare groups who differ in their treatment. However, in observational settings where random allocation into different treatments is not possible, researchers may employ methods that such as 'matching' or 'weighting' of participants to ensure that the different treatment groups being compared are 'balanced' with respect to other characteristics.",Temp
Approach PSM description,You've chosen propensity matching. This approach involves creating balanced comparison groups by matching treated individuals with similar untreated individuals based on their propensity scores (probability of someone having a specific treatment based on a set of ‘matching variables’). This aims to ensure that the groups are comparable in terms of potential confounding variables. The treatment effect is then estimated by comparing outcomes between the matched groups. ,Temp
Approach CA link, For further guidance on choosing an approach see the ‘choosing a counterfactual analysis approach’ section of the tutorials.,Temp
Approach PSM link, See the ‘propensity matching’ section of the tutorials for more information.,Temp
Approach IPTW description,"You’ve chosen IPTW. IPTW aims to rebalance treated and untreated individuals using a weighted regression approach. It first estimates propensity scores (probability of someone having a specific treatment based on a set of ‘matching variables’. It then transforms these into weights that are used in a regression model to up-weight (i.e., give more importance to) untreated and treated cases that are similar in terms of their propensity scores and down-weight cases that are very different. This helps to rebalance the treated and untreated groups.",Temp
Approach IPTW link,See the ‘IPTW’ section of the tutorials for more information.,Temp
Approach NBP description,"As you have an ordinal treatment variable (i.e., an ordered categorical treatment variable) an appropriate counterfactual analysis approach is non-bipartite propensity matching (NBP). NBP finds pairs of people who differ in their treatment dosage but who have similar treatment propensities based on their matching variables and compares their outcome variable levels. As the treatment is ordinal, this might involve matching and comparing people with for example, low with medium treatment doses and medium with high doses.",Temp

Approach Missingness description,"Missing data can reduce statistical power and introduce bias when it is related to the variables under study. In order to minimise the impact of missingness in our data, DigiCAT offers several approaches to handle missing values. ",Temp
Approach Missingness tutorial link,"For more information on missingness, see the ‘missing data’ section of the tutorials.",Temp
Approach MI description,"The fundamental idea behind multiple imputation is to create several (M) completed datasets by predicting what the missing values would have been if we could observe them. These datasets are then analysed separately, and the results of each of these datasets are combined, or ‘pooled’, together. The variability across datasets allows the standard errors to take account of the uncertainty due to the fact that some of the data are predicted rather than observed. DigiCAT imputes 5 complete datasets, conducts the analysis in each and then combines the results across them. However, don’t forget that this statistical method relies on assumptions, which can be difficult to test. If these assumptions are violated, your inferences may be invalid. Multiple imputation assumes ‘missingness at random’ (MAR) meaning that the missingness depends on the data you have available in your model but not on the unobserved values of the outcome variable.",Temp
Approach MI tutorial link,Please see our tutorial pages on multiple imputation for a detailed discussion.,Temp
Approach CC description,"Complete case analysis (CCA) (also sometimes known as ‘listwise deletion’), will only analyse the completely observed cases. This analysis will allow valid inferences of your data if the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR), because the observed values will be a random sample of the complete dataset. If the data are missing at random (MAR) which means that the missingness can be predicted from the data available or missing not at random (MNAR), the inferences may be invalid.",Temp
Approach CC tutorial link,Please see our tutorial pages for a detailed discussion of complete case analysis.,Temp
Approach Weighting description,Non-response weighting deals with missingness by up-weighting cases that have a low probability of being observed in the sample and down-weighting variables that have a high probability of being observed in the sample. This is done using a weighted regression approach. These weights are often supplied with datasets and are selected at the ‘data upload’ stage of DigiCAT. ,Temp

It's a meta-estimator where weak models, in this case, decision trees, are sequentially trained to correct the errors of the previous ones.

Balancing Optimal ordinal description,"NBP uses a version of optimal matching to pair up cases who experienced different dosages of the treatment variable (e.g., high versus medium; medium versus low).

The model takes the form y = 1 / (1 + exp(-(bX + e)), where y and x are our outcome and explanatory variables respectively, and e is the random error. The functional form of the model is bounded between zero and one and so can be interpreted as the probability that the outcome is positive (y = 1). Of interest here is the exp(b), which is the odds ratio of the treatment effect. As an example, if exp(B) = 2 then the outcome is twice as likely to occur in the treated population than the non treated.

Outcome LogReg wo covar description,This option will fit a logistic regression with your chosen outcome and just the treatment variable as a predictor using the matched data or IPTW weights. Note that this method does not take into account the paired nature of the data when used with a matching method like propensity score matching for binary treatments or NBP for ordinal treatments.,Temp

Outcome model output SE description,The standard error is a statistical measure that quantifies the variability or uncertainty associated with the estimate. It provides a measure of how much the estimate is likely to vary from the true population value.,Temp

Outcome model output P description,"In null-hypothesis significance testing, the p-value represents the the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Typically, if the p-value is below a predetermined significance level (often 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of an alternative hypothesis, implying that there is a statistically significant effect or relationship in the data.",Temp
